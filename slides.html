      #Learning Goals
      * I learned how User Experience Design affects our lives in both good and bad ways.
      * I learned how User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design go hand in hand.
      * I learned about how different experiences like genders, cultures, languages, and backgrounds shape how we use technology daily.
      * I learned how to collaborate with my team members to solve a real-world problem.
      * I learned responsibility and decisions between user and designer when it comes to behaviours and to practice good digital citizenship.
      * I learned how to give constructive design feedback.

    <!-- .element: class="delayed" --><img src="framework\img\don-norman.jpeg" alt="Don Norman" style="width: 400px;">

    <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
    Don Norman, a cognitive scientist and co-founder of the Nielsen Norman Group Design Consultancy, coined the term in the late 1990s declaring that <b>‚ÄúUser experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user‚Äôs interaction with the company, its services, and its products.‚Äù</b>

    <p></p>
    #Where is the D(esign) word?<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
    <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->User Experience includes <b>all mediums</b>, not just design. This includes all interactions with people, whether it‚Äôs print, digital, or even fixing your IKEA shelf!

      #History of Agile UX
        <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->The Agile UX process came from Agile Software methodology. It values <b>individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools. Its goal is creating working software over comprehensive documentation. The Agile method uses <b>sprints</b> to prioritize builds based on requirements.

        <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        The Agile UX Process was made famous by <b>Jake Knapp and Google Ventures.</b>
        The design sprint originated from <b>IDEO's human-centered design process,</b> which is closely linked to Stanford and its d.school. Scrum and Kanban are popular ways in which UX is used with Agile.

      * What do you do (for a living)?
      * Do you have children / family? Can you tell me more about them?

      #Activity 4 - Wireframing your Prototype
      ##Using your prototypes, let's start creating your digital wireframes.
       * Pre-built elements help you to focus on the **functionality of the design** and not get lost in detail.
       * Wireframes let us **simplify the interface** using shapes and layout, and are helpful for communicating high-level structure.
       * Using colour is **optional** for low - medium fidelity wireframes.

      Break out into groups and start testing your prototype with your teammates.

      ##Before you start, here are some tips:
      * Check for confirmation bias.
      * Have someone else review your test plan and give feedback.
      * Avoid asking leading questions (ie. Did  you choose this because of X?).

      ##Observe if your user:
      * Prefers elements in the design over others.
      * Spends a long time reading a section without carrying out an action.
      * Struggles with a task or part of the design by going to an element repeatedly, expecting something to happen.

    #How does Ethics go with Equity?<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
    <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->Ethics ensures that we, as designers, are **meeting our users/person's needs.**
    By being mindful of ethical practices, we can ensure that our design provides users with what they need to **improve their lives**.

      #What is designing for accessibility?
        <p class="delayed">In practice, accessibility is about designing for users with disabilities. Philosophically, it isn‚Äôt so much about designing for disability as it is about *designing for everyone*.
        </p>

      ##Why design for accessibility?<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      * By designing for as many people as possible, the design and product reaches a wider usage.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      * It reframes public perception and reduces stigmas surrounding user barriers. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      * Challenges designers and provides unique UX insights.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

    <script type="text/template">
    #What is Copyright?
    Copyright is the exclusive right to control reproduction and commercial exploitation of your work.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

    ##Why is Copyright important?<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
    By default, original work is automatically protected by copyright when you create it. However, when you register your copyright, you get a certificate that you can use in court as evidence that you own the protected work.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
    </script>

  <section class="slide" data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    #What should designers do to protect their work?
    * Register your work.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      - Having work registered is a requirement to sue for infringement, and registering before infringement happens will make copyright issues that much easier to resolve.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      - This saves money in the future if hiring a lawyer is necessary.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->


    * Know your clients and the contract in detail.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      - Your creative rights is determined by the contract. You can license limited usage rights in your work, in which case you keep your copyright.
      You can also assign copyright to your client, create the work as ‚Äúwork made for hire,‚Äù  which in both cases means the copyright in your work belongs to the client.


    * Be aware of infringing trademark.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      - When designing logos or images that may be used for branding, be aware that your designs could infringe someone else‚Äôs trademark rights, even if you didn‚Äôt intentionally copy their brand.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->


    * Be aware of fair dealing.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      - The Canadian Copyright Act allows the use of material from a copyright protected work without permission when certain conditions are met. Fair dealing is allowed for research, education, parody, review, and news reporting.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
